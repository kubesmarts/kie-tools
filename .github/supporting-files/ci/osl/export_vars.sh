#  1) `pnpm build-env --print-dotenv` (from packages/redhat-env)
#  2) a local `.env` (alongside this script)
#
# • In GitHub Actions ($GITHUB_ENV set): appends the merged KEY=VALUE
#   lines into $GITHUB_ENV so later steps see them.
# • Locally: writes merged KEY=VALUE lines to stdout, so you can:
#     eval "$(bash path/to/export_vars.sh)"
#   or
#     source <(bash path/to/export_vars.sh)
